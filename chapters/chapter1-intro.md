# Chapter 1: Introduction to the Code 10 Driver’s Licence (South Africa)

The **Code 10 licence** is a commonly used name in South Africa for what is formally aligned with the **Code C1 category**. It is designed for drivers who want to operate **medium-to-heavy vehicles**, bigger than standard passenger cars and light delivery vehicles. According to the South African government’s licensing categories, **Code C1 covers motor vehicles, minibuses, and buses with a gross vehicle mass (GVM) between 3 500 kg and 16 000 kg**, and you must be **18 years or older** to apply. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

This licence is an important step for people who aim to work in logistics, distribution, passenger transport, construction, and municipal or private fleet operations. It also serves as a foundation for heavier or combination licences, depending on your career path.

## What you can drive with Code 10 (C1)

With this licence, you may drive:
- A **goods vehicle** within the 3 500–16 000 kg GVM range  
- A **bus or minibus** within the same GVM category  
This places Code 10 above the standard **Code B**, which is limited to vehicles **not exceeding 3 500 kg GVM**. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## A quick note on trailers and combinations

South Africa also issues separate codes for articulated or combination vehicles. For example, **Code EC1** relates to heavier vehicles pulling trailers in the same broad mass range, while **Code EC** applies to heavier combinations. These are listed alongside Code C1 on the official licence code breakdown. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

This guide will focus mainly on the Code 10/Code C1 path, while highlighting where combination categories may become relevant.

## Learner’s licence comes first

Before you can apply for any driving licence in South Africa, including Code 10, you must hold a **valid learner’s licence**. The government’s process is clear that the learner’s licence is a prerequisite before booking and completing your driving test at a **Driving Licence Testing Centre (DLTC)**. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## When you may also need a PrDP

If you plan to drive **for income** involving:
- **goods vehicles over 3 500 kg GVM**,  
- **passengers**, or  
- **dangerous goods**,  

you may need a **Professional Driving Permit (PrDP)** in addition to your driving licence. This is a legal requirement for certain commercial uses and comes with its own age and fitness criteria. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
